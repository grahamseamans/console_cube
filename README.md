# Spinning Cube

It's also got a tetrahedron but more the merrier.
It should run in a average python setup, the strangest
library used is numpy, and the console commands are 
VT100 so they should work almost everywhere.

I want to fix the gaps between triangles on
faces that can be seen on the cube, but I've got to 
sink some time into more practical issues.

I hope this bring you joy like it does for me! look at
those bad boys spin. :)
