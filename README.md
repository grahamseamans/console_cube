# Spinning 3d Shapes

To run: `$ python scr/main.py`

This program will run a spinning cube and tetrahedron 
to the console window. It should run in an average Python 
setup. The strangest library used is Numpy, and the 
console commands are VT100 so they should work almost everywhere.

It's a work in progress that I get to whenever I have a little
time, so it is updated, but very irregularly.

I hope this bring you joy like it does for me! look at
those bad boys spin. :)
