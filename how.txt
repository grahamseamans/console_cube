so first:
	get started with processing!
	make the cube, play round with it,
	have some fun :)

	notes:
	the points are vectors
	the vectors are in whatever space you want (3d here)

	then things are moved around in 3d space with matrix
	transforms. This works for rotations because the cube 
	because it's centered around the origin.

	the vectors are then multed by a 2x3 matrix to get them
	into 2d space

	you can then take these points and draw lines between
	them. You could do this in 3d space, but that's just 
	more work in this case.

Then:
	So rendering for the console seems to be doable with 
	this weird command:
		echo -e "\x1B[5;10H<something>"
	where <something> is what you want to print
	to the console

	it seems like the console letters are 2 tall and 1
	wide, so our 2d projection matrix needs to scale width
	by half

	because our image is centered on zero when processing
	we need to move it up and right when putting it onto
	the console


	with this what we need to do is:
		make a grid that is our picture
		render our picture
		subtract the two
		print what is different between them
		profit?
	
	so lets start out with baby steps:
		a 500 x 500 grid of nothing
		just blank out the console


then:
	put the cube into the console.

then:
	put the square into a square class

	make a tetrahedron class
		done

	make surfaces
		make shape classes
			transfer everything over to being triangles?
			you then need to have points->triangels/squares->shapes

		get the surface normals for shapes
			see if they're dot product with z+ is positive
			if it it display it

		as for displaying:
			make a render function to rasterize a triangle or a 
			square (fill between points with a character)

		to make shading:
			make a lighting direction vector
			dot product that with the surface normal to get shade
			use that number as how you select the shade of a surface.

---------------------------------------------

so we're where we wanted to get to. it took much less time than we 
thought it would. so what do next?

- make it run faster
	research triange rastering. cprofile says it's way slow.
	
- store the screen non-flattened
	so you're not always translating back and forth

- add shadows?
	lord know's how, but you could probably just project the rotated 
	shape down and get a shadow, but then you would need a surface
	and depth perception

	add shadows
